Place holder for future Dataset commits'

26th June 2021- 

Updated the BSL dataset with 10 images for each alphabet, for 37 alphabets in total.
Uploaded the photos on the drive folder, as it is too large to be uploaded on GIT.
Will expand the dataset further next week.

Did some research on published papers on similar projects. Will be updating on them soon. 
Working on the project report.

---------------------------------------------------------------

Added 260 photos to 26 alphabets in total. need to retake the rest of them to update again.

Contributed to the report. Added better descriptions to the existing paragraphs. 
Now that I have read a lot of research papers for the paper review, I understand how to write the report better.
Trying to follow the unofficial standards for the report.
