Place holder for future Dataset commits'

26th June 2021- 

Updated the BSL dataset with 10 images for each alphabet, for 37 alphabets in total.
Uploaded the photos on the drive folder, as it is too large to be uploaded on GIT.
Will expand the dataset further next week.

Working on the project report.
